# Smoothness-Adaptive-Contextual-Bandits

This repository imlements the simultions for showcasing the cost of smoothness misspecification in the non-parametric contextual bandits setting. We compare the performance of three policies: the - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?O_t=\text {\texttt{SACB}} t " />  policy that adapts to smoothness, \texttt{ABSE}($\beta$) proposed by Perchet and Rigollet
(2013) which is initiated by the correct smoothness parameter $\beta$, and \texttt{ABSE}($\hat \beta$) which is initiated by the misspecified smoothness parameter $\hat \beta$.
